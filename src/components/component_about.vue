    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      I am a developer with over 10 years of experience. I work with C #, ASP,
      PHP, JS (JQuery, Json, Ajax ...), AS, SQL (MS / MY), HTML5, CSS ... I have
      developed powerful data collection and processing applications. I know how
      to optimize when the standard framework fails and doesn't want to handle a
      large data stream (multiple thread conflicts). I can develop plugins for
      ready-made projects and much more.
